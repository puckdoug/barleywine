Barleywine Static Server - Test Text File
==========================================

This is a plain text file used to test MIME type detection in the Rocket static file server.

When this file is requested, it should be served with the MIME type: text/plain

Server Features Being Tested:
-----------------------------
- Static file serving from webroot directory
- Automatic MIME type detection based on file extensions
- Text file delivery (.txt extension)

File Details:
- Filename: test.txt
- Expected MIME type: text/plain
- Server: Rocket (Rust web framework)
- Location: /webroot/test.txt

Test Instructions:
1. Start the Barleywine server
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/test.txt
3. Verify the file is served correctly
4. Check browser developer tools to confirm MIME type

Additional Test Files:
- index.html (text/html)
- styles.css (text/css)
- script.js (application/javascript)
- subdir/index.html (text/html)

The Rocket NamedFile responder automatically detects MIME types based on file extensions,
so this file should be served with the correct Content-Type header.
