# Blog Directory Index

Welcome to the **blog directory**! This page demonstrates how Barleywine automatically serves `index.md` files when a directory is requested.

## How It Works

When you visit `/blog/`, the server:

1. Detects that `blog` is a directory
2. Looks for `index.html` first
3. If not found, looks for `index.md`
4. Converts the markdown to HTML on-the-fly
5. Serves it with beautiful styling

## Directory Structure

```
webroot/
├── blog/
│   ├── index.md        ← You are here!
│   ├── post-1.md
│   ├── post-2.md
│   └── archives/
│       └── index.md
├── sample.md
└── index.html
```
