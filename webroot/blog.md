### 2024-01-15: Building a Static Site Server with Rust

Today I'm excited to share how we built Barleywine, a lightning-fast static file server that automatically converts markdown files to beautifully styled HTML pages.

**Key Features:**
- 🚀 Built with Rocket web framework
- 📝 Automatic markdown-to-HTML conversion
- 🎨 Beautiful default styling
- ⚡ Zero-configuration setup
- 🔒 Secure file serving

The journey started with a simple question: *"What if we could serve markdown files as HTML without any build step?"*

```rust
// Simple markdown serving with Rocket
#[get("/<file..>")]
async fn serve_markdown(file: PathBuf) -> Result<RawHtml<String>, NotFound<String>> {
    let content = fs::read_to_string(&file)?;
    let html = markdown::to_html(&content);
    Ok(RawHtml(create_template(&html)))
}
```

> **Pro Tip:** The beauty of this approach is that you can edit markdown files directly and see changes immediately without any compilation step!

### 2024-01-10: Why Static Sites Matter in 2024

Static sites are making a huge comeback, and for good reason:

1. **Performance** - No database queries, just fast file serving
2. **Security** - Minimal attack surface
3. **Scalability** - Easy to cache and distribute
4. **Simplicity** - Version control your content like code

#### Comparison Table

| Feature | Dynamic Sites | Static Sites |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Speed | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Security | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Hosting Cost | $$$ | $ |
| Complexity | High | Low |

The winner is clear! Static sites provide better performance, security, and cost-effectiveness.

### 2024-01-05: Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's perfect for writing content. Here's a quick primer:

#### Text Formatting
- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italic*: `*text*` or `_text_`
- `Code`: \`code\`
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~text~~`

#### Lists and Structure

**Unordered Lists:**
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item

**Ordered Lists:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

#### Code Blocks

```bash
# Start the Barleywine server
cargo run

# Server starts on http://localhost:8000
```

```javascript
// Add interactivity to your markdown pages
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('Markdown page loaded! 🎉');
});
```
